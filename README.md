# Monster splatter

## About

This is my learning / experimentation in TypeScript (and JS) building
something that actually does more than your average DOM manipulation.

I'm writing it for my daughter who likes to sit with me when I'm working
and play little games like this.

As it stands, it is very basic, but I plan to try and integrate tests
as well as more typescript features (like classes which it is missing at the
moment).

I've already learnt a good deal getting it going.

## Development

VSCode (with extensions):

- Debugger for Chrome
- TSLint

Node (and packages):

- `npm install -g tslint typescript`
- `npm install -g live-server`

## Debugging in Code

- Open Terminal, run `live-server`
- F5 with `Launch localhost with sourcemaps`
- Makes changes, rebuild (`Ctrl+Shift+B`), live server picks them up.
