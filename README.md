## About

This is my learning / experimentation in Fable / Elmish / Fulma
something that actually does more than your average DOM manipulation.

I'm writing it for my daughter who likes to sit with me when I'm working
and play little games like this.

As it stands, it is very basic, but I plan to try and integrate tests
as well as more features.

I've already learnt a good deal getting it going.
